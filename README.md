## Model of Meiotic Recombination ✂️✂️


__[Check out model here!](https://shivchitinous.github.io/recombinator/recombination.html)__

I simulate meiotic recombination on a chromosome and visualize how recombination frequency depends on number of crossovers between genes as well as reombination hotspots.
